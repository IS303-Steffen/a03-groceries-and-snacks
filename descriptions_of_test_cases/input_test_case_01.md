# Test Case 1

## Description
Adding an item, checking if that same item is in the list (it should be), and then removing that item from the list. The list should have 2 things in it at the end.

```
1: "pasta"

3: "pasta"
```

## Example Output
This is what your terminal should look like if you use the inputs above when running your code.
```

Enter a new grocery item to add: pasta

Enter an item to see if it's in your list: pasta
